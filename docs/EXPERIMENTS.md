## E1 — Conditional EV by pre-deal signal (first attack reconnaissance)

**Date:** 2026-07-17 · **Command:** `signals --rules {h17,ridefree} --seed 31337
--rounds 3000000` · **Signals:** exact P(free-split pair), exact P(free-double hand),
hi-lo true count — all perfect-information from tracked composition.

### Findings

1. **M5 sanity gate: PASSED.** Standard game EV rises monotonically with hi-lo TC,
   ≈ +0.6%/TC through the bulk (−4.8% at TC−6 → +2.1% at TC+5). The signal pipeline
   (tracker → TC → conditional EV) is trustworthy.

2. **The anti-correlation hypothesis is confirmed, strongly.**
   corr(p_free_double, hilo_tc) = **−0.937**; corr(p_pair, hilo_tc) = −0.724.
   Double-rich shoes are small-card shoes are bad shoes.

3. **Naive event-betting is REFUTED for both signals.** On Ride Free, EV *falls* as
   either signal rises: p_free_double runs +1.0% (at 0.07) down to −5.5% (at 0.17);
   p_pair peaks around 0.040–0.045 and declines toward both extremes. Betting more
   when free bets are more likely means betting more into worse shoes. As standalone
   bet triggers, both signals are inverted proxies for the count.

4. **But the free-bet value is real and localized — visible in the (Ride Free −
   standard) difference curves.** By p_pair bin: −2.9% at 0.035 rising monotonically
   to +2.4% at 0.065 — free splits add ~2–3% *relative* EV in pair-rich shoes. By
   p_free_double bin: ~−1.5% at 0.08 rising to ~+1.4% at 0.16. The free-bet features
   pay off exactly where the events are frequent; the base game just deteriorates
   faster in those same shoes.

5. **Hi-lo works on Ride Free.** EV rises ≈ +0.45%/TC, crossing zero around TC +3/+4
   (later than standard because the base edge is higher: −1.11% overall this run).
   A plain counter has a real, if thin, positive-EV region.

6. **Pairs beat doubles on independence — Matt's instinct has support.**
   p_free_double shares r² = 0.88 of its variance with the count: it carries almost
   no information a counter doesn't already have. p_pair shares only r² = 0.52 —
   roughly half its variance is *orthogonal* to the count. If either event signal
   adds value on top of counting, pairs is the better candidate.

### Verdict and next question

The 1D attack is dead; the 2D question is now sharp: **at fixed true count, does
pair-richness still predict EV?** Next experiment: 2D conditional EV binned by
(hilo_tc × p_pair) on Ride Free, plus the analytic ramp evaluation over the hi-lo
curve as the baseline any hybrid must beat.
